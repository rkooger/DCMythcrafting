<h1>DC Mythcrafting: Cyclotron</h1>
  <p>Terrence Curtis and Teresa Curtis worked on the Change Engine Project. When it went unstable and exploded, they both received lethal doses of thorium radiation. The explosion caused an earthquake that freed King Kull. Terrence had a grad student named Al Pratt aka The Atom. Cub Reporter Billy Batson came to report on the explosion and when King Kull emerged, Billy became Captain Marvel. King Kull escaped and captured the Curtis's. He imprisoned Terri in a stasis chamber to keep the atomic energy from killing her and to keep her as a hostage. Terry was placed inside special armor that harnessed his atomic energy so he could do King Kull's dirty work.</p>
  <p>Atom and Captain Marvel defeated King Kull and Cyclotron before they could finish building an atomic weapon. Cyclotron defected and attacked King Kull, sacrificing himself in the process. Atom was exposed to Cyclotron's atomic blasts and gained his atomic powers. Atom adopted a new costume inspired by Cyclotron's containment suit. Atom looked after Terri and helped cure her radiation poisoning.</p>

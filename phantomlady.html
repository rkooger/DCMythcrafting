<h1>DC Mythcrafting: Phantom Lady</h1>
  <p>Senator Henry Knight was the political force behind the Change Engine Project. His daughter, Sandra Knight, was visiting it with him on the day of the explosion. She was caught in the blast wave and her quantum signature was disrupted. Professor Abraham Davies and Ted Knight, her cousin, managed to stabilize her and bring her back into phase. She gained powers from this experience. Senator Knight decided to shut down the project and seal away the change engine.</p>
  <p>Sandra learned to control her new abilities and when Fifth Columnists tried to abduct her father to extract the secrets of the Change Engine from him, she used her abilities to defeat them, and decided to become Phantom Lady.</p>
